Please report any bugs, problems or feature requests related to simplebuild in
the issue tracker at https://github.com/mctools/simplebuild/issues.

History
=======

The simplebuild build system originated in the coding and simulation framework
"dgbuild"/"dgcode" which was developed by Thomas Kittelmann in the Detector
Group at the European Spallation Source ERIC since 2012. This work was supported
in part by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme
under grant agreement No 676548 (the BrightnESS project).

Around 2023 the code was refactored, rebranded, cleaned up, and released under
the current open source license by Thomas Kittelmann and Milan Klausz. The
result is two open source projects, the build system ("simplebuild") and the
Geant4-based simulation framework implemented as a set of simplebuild packages
("simplebuild-dgcode").

The main active developers are currently:

* Thomas Kittelmann (DMSC, European Spallation Source ERIC). Main developer.
* Milan Klausz (HUN-REN Centre for Energy Research). Developer and CI expert.

Historically several other people also contributed to the development of the
code. Of particular note is the work and support by Kalliopi Kanaki (former ESS
ERIC, now IAEA), Xiao Xiao Cai (former DTU, now CSNS) and Richard Hall-Wilton
(former ESS ERIC, now FDK-SD).
